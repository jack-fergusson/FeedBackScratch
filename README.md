# FeedBackScratch

The journey to improve one’s self is among the most noble journeys that a person can go through. However, aspects of achieving this goal are much too complicated. Even in the age of instantaneous communication, it is difficult to receive consistent, quality feedback for your work from knowledgeable people online. My website, FeedBackScratch, aims to make it easier for people to improve themselves through online feedback by creating a collaborative community for various groups.

The website will be home to a variety of different sub-communities that users can choose to partake in, all focused around helping others to improve through feedback and discussion of the community's topic. These topics will range from arts (music, visual art, writing) to educational topics (coding, engineering, essay writing) and anything else that could greatly benefit from credible feedback (powerlifting, disc golf, fashion). Each community will have a ‘spotlight’ submission that remains active for a certain time interval, depending on the amount of submissions the community has received that day. In order for a user to submit their own work each day, they must provide quality feedback for whatever post was in the spotlight when they entered the community that day. Once they have completed this task, users are free to join a discussion, message other users, or continue to give feedback. This system ensures that all submissions will receive adequate engagement, not just the most popular ones. 

In order to incentivize creators of differing skill levels to use the website, users will be sorted into tiers based upon their level of skill, experience, and expertise in the given field. More knowledgeable users will be allotted a slightly greater time in the ‘spotlight’ in exchange for their more valuable feedback. In this way, the benefits of using the website are multifaceted, as smaller creators can use the site to improve their craft, while larger creators can reach broader audiences in exchange for their professional feedback, leading to an overall better community.

One of the issues with existing feedback forums is that longer works will never receive any engagement, as people will look for smaller works on which to provide their mandatory feedback. To fix this, FeedBackScratch will require a user to provide feedback for a work of similar length or complexity as theirs before submitting their work to the website. This ensures that submissions of all types will benefit from using the service, and no user is randomly inconvenienced by an incredibly large submission that they must review.

This website will allow for many opportunities to turn users into customers for a mutually beneficial relationship. For example, users could pay the site in order to have more time in the ‘spotlight’, giving their art more exposure and hopefully leading to an influx of traffic for their respective pages. Alternatively, smaller creators may be inclined to pay for a greater chance of receiving feedback from those with the most expertise. 

Overall, the goal of this project is to help people that want to improve in any aspect of life. I believe that the most important aspect of improvement is to try, try, and try again, but you must be told what works and what does not in order to truly better yourself. I believe that this website will create a strong community of like-minded people, helping all of those who choose to participate.
